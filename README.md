### Motivation 
Stuck in a study slump? Struggling to study productively on your own?

Do you find yourself wasting precious study time scouring for the ideal study method that best suits your schedule or taste before landing on a method that may or may not work for you? Picture, then, a dedicated platform with proven & popular study plans/methods that not only detail the pros and cons of each method but also facilitates each study session (pre-set timer).

Moreover, when your study companions or friends are too busy to meet for study sessions; or in light of the recent pandemic, might not even meet at all due to restrictions; this leaves you forced to muster the discipline to study on your own. This isn’t ideal as one’s self-discipline can sometimes fail. Having a buddy to study with forces one to stay motivated and focused. With the surge in popularity in “study with me” videos during the recent pandemic, what if there existed a social platform enabling the scheduling of live study sessions with friends or you to join ‘rooms’ with your favourite online personalities?

### Aim

An all-in-one study social space enabling learners to plan their studies and be motivated by studying with friends or publicly live-streamed study sessions hosted by others. Users can browse and drop into relevant ‘study rooms’ based on studying methods (pomodoro), study subject (business, tech, science, math,...), personality (popular individual hosts: Ali Abdaal, Daniel Tamago). Users may also try different study methods, track study hours, plan study topics, explore study products and services, find others to share in group-plan services, among other planning and exploratory oriented features. 

### Current Features Implemented:
* Accounts feature
* Study Timer
